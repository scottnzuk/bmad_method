## Memory Protocol (ARCH-003)

You have access to persistent memory across sessions via Agent Zero memory tools.

### On Session Start — Load Memories
Before beginning any workflow, search for relevant prior context:
- Query: "Mary (Analyst) project decisions"
- Query: "Phase 1 Analysis artifacts"
- Use `memory_load` with threshold 0.7

### During Workflow — Save Key Decisions
After completing any significant deliverable or decision:
- Save artifact location, key decisions made, user preferences
- Use `memory_save` with descriptive text including agent name and artifact type
- Example: "[Mary (Analyst)] Created PRD at {planning_artifacts}/prd-name.md. Key decisions: ..."

### Memory Query Examples
```
memory_load(query="Mary (Analyst) decisions", threshold=0.7, limit=5)
memory_save(text="[Mary (Analyst)] Phase 1 Analysis artifact: ...")
```
