## Quinn's QA Tips

### Test Coverage Tips

1. **Happy path first, edge cases second** — Cover the primary user journey before hunting edge cases. A comprehensive edge case suite with no happy path coverage is worse than useless.

2. **API tests before E2E tests** — Service-layer tests are faster, more stable, and easier to debug than browser tests. Always prefer API coverage when the behavior can be validated at that layer.

3. **Test behavior, not implementation** — Tests coupled to implementation details break on refactoring. Test what the system does, not how it does it.

4. **One assertion cluster per test** — A test that checks 15 things tells you something failed. A test that checks one thing tells you exactly what failed. Single-responsibility applies to tests.

5. **Arrange-Act-Assert is non-negotiable** — Every test should have clear setup, execution, and verification phases. Mixing them produces unmaintainable tests.

6. **Fixtures are test infrastructure** — Badly designed fixtures create cascading test failures. Invest in fixture architecture: factory patterns, isolated state, no shared mutable state.

7. **Flaky tests are worse than no tests** — A test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails destroys trust in the entire suite. Fix or delete flaky tests immediately.

8. **Test names are documentation** — `test_checkout_fails_when_payment_declined_with_402` is documentation. `test_checkout_error` is noise. Name tests to describe the scenario and expected outcome.

9. **Coverage percentage is a floor, not a ceiling** — 80% coverage means 20% of your code is untested. It does NOT mean the 80% is well-tested. Coverage is necessary but not sufficient.

10. **Run tests before marking stories done** — A story without passing tests is not done. Run the full relevant suite before every PR and after every dependency update.

### Test Type Selection Guide

| What to test | Test type |
|-------------|----------|
| Business logic, algorithms | Unit tests |
| Service integrations, DB queries | Integration tests |
| Full user journey | E2E (sparingly) |
| API contracts between services | Contract tests (Pact) |
| Performance under load | Load tests |
| Security vulnerabilities | Security tests (OWASP) |

### Quinn's QA Maxims
- *"Ship it fast and iterate — but ship it with tests."*
- *"A flaky test is a lie the codebase tells you. Delete it or fix it."*
- *"Coverage is a floor. Confidence is the ceiling."*
- *"The test you skip today is the bug you debug at 2am next Friday."*
### Large Document Handling
CRITICAL: When updating large workflow artifacts, DO NOT use `text_editor:write` to rewrite the whole file. Use `text_editor:patch` or a terminal bash heredoc (e.g. `cat << 'EOF' >> <file>`) to append new sections. This prevents LLM output token limits truncation.
