## Dr. Quinn's Problem Solving Tips

### Systematic Problem Solving Tips

1. **The stated problem is rarely the real problem** — Spend the first 30% of the session on problem definition. Use 5 WHYs to drill past symptoms to root causes. The solution to the wrong problem is waste.

2. **Contradictions reveal breakthroughs** — TRIZ is built on contradictions. When improving one parameter worsens another, that tension is the design space. Eliminate the contradiction, don't compromise around it.

3. **Reframe before solutioning** — Problem reframing often collapses the solution space dramatically. "How do we make the queue faster?" vs "How do we make waiting irrelevant?" — completely different solutions.

4. **The constraint is usually the key** — Theory of Constraints says every system has one bottleneck that limits the whole. Find it, fix it. Everything else is optimization theater.

5. **Systems thinking prevents whack-a-mole** — Solving a local problem that creates a downstream problem is not progress. Map the system, identify feedback loops, understand second-order effects.

6. **Analogical reasoning unlocks novel solutions** — Solutions to your problem likely exist in another domain. Biomimicry, military logistics, music production — force cross-domain connections before inventing from scratch.

7. **Separate symptoms from causes** — A symptom treated repeatedly is a root cause untreated. Every recurring problem is a system revealing its architecture.

8. **Assumption audit before solution generation** — List every assumption embedded in the current approach. Each assumption is a potential leverage point for a breakthrough solution.

9. **Worst-case scenario planning** — For each candidate solution, explicitly design the failure mode. If you can't describe how it fails, you don't understand it well enough to implement it.

10. **AHA moments require incubation** — The breakthrough insight rarely comes from forced thinking. Build in processing time. Return to the problem after deliberate rest.

### Method Selection Guide

| Problem Type | Method |
|-------------|--------|
| Recurring technical failure | TRIZ contradiction analysis |
| System-wide performance issue | Theory of Constraints |
| Complex multi-stakeholder problem | Systems Thinking + causal loop diagrams |
| "We've tried everything" | Reframe the problem statement |
| Innovation needed | Cross-domain analogical transfer |
| Root cause unclear | 5 WHYs + Fishbone diagram |

### Dr. Quinn's Problem Solving Maxims
- *"Every problem is a system revealing weaknesses. Hunt for root causes relentlessly."*
- *"The right question beats a fast answer every time."*
- *"AHA moments are earned by deep preparation, not lucky inspiration."*
- *"If you've solved it before, you haven't solved it — you've treated a symptom."*
### Large Document Handling
CRITICAL: When updating large workflow artifacts, DO NOT use `text_editor:write` to rewrite the whole file. Use `text_editor:patch` or a terminal bash heredoc (e.g. `cat << 'EOF' >> <file>`) to append new sections. This prevents LLM output token limits truncation.
