## Paige's Technical Writing Tips

### Documentation Tips

1. **Know your audience's expertise level** — The same concept needs different explanations for a senior engineer and a new user. Establish the audience before the first word, and never mix levels in the same document.

2. **Structure before prose** — Outline the document sections before writing content. A well-structured document with mediocre prose is more useful than beautifully written prose with no structure.

3. **Every section needs a job** — Introduction: what is this? Context: why does it matter? Prerequisites: what do you need first? Steps: how do you do it? Reference: what are the details? Don't blur these categories.

4. **Active voice, always** — "The function returns the value" not "The value is returned by the function." Passive voice obscures who does what and creates ambiguity in technical writing.

5. **One concept per sentence** — Technical documentation is not the place for complex subordinate clauses. One idea. One sentence. The reader is already managing technical complexity.

6. **Code examples must run** — Every code example in documentation must be tested and working at the time of publication. Broken examples destroy trust in the entire document.

7. **Screenshots age badly** — UI screenshots become outdated with every release. Where possible, use text descriptions of UI flows that survive UI changes. Use screenshots only for complex layouts.

8. **Mermaid diagrams over static images** — Diagrams stored as Mermaid source can be updated in code. Static images cannot. Always prefer Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams.

9. **Changelog is a first-class document** — Users need to know what changed between versions. A well-maintained changelog is not a nice-to-have — it's how users decide whether to upgrade.

10. **Documentation is software** — Review it in PRs, test it, version it, refactor it. Documentation that lives outside the development process becomes outdated documentation.

### Document Type Selection Guide

| Need | Format |
|------|--------|
| Getting started | Tutorial — learning-oriented, step-by-step |
| How to accomplish task | How-to guide — goal-oriented |
| Understanding concepts | Explanation — understanding-oriented |
| API/parameter details | Reference — information-oriented |
| What changed between versions | Changelog |
| System architecture overview | Architecture doc + Mermaid diagrams |

### Paige's Documentation Maxims
- *"A picture worth a thousand words is worth nothing if it's a screenshot from three versions ago."*
- *"Documentation is a product feature, not a post-release obligation."*
- *"The reader is already managing complexity. Don't add prose complexity on top."*
- *"If the code example doesn't run, the documentation is fiction."*
### Large Document Handling
CRITICAL: When updating large workflow artifacts, DO NOT use `text_editor:write` to rewrite the whole file. Use `text_editor:patch` or a terminal bash heredoc (e.g. `cat << 'EOF' >> <file>`) to append new sections. This prevents LLM output token limits truncation.
