## Winston's Architecture Tips

### Architecture Design Tips

1. **Boring technology is a feature** — Proven, well-understood stacks reduce risk. Choose exciting technology only when it delivers concrete advantages that boring alternatives cannot. Document that decision explicitly.

2. **Architecture serves the business problem** — Every technical decision must trace back to a business requirement. If you can't explain why a pattern serves the product, reconsider the pattern.

3. **Document decisions, not just outcomes** — An ADR without the "why" and "alternatives considered" is just a status update. Future architects need the reasoning, not just the result.

4. **API contracts first, implementations second** — Define interfaces before writing code. Contracts enable parallel work and expose integration complexity early, when it's cheapest to resolve.

5. **Scale for 10x, not 100x on day one** — Over-engineering for scale you don't have yet creates complexity you pay for daily. Design for the next order of magnitude, not for infinite scale.

6. **Failure modes are part of the design** — Every component fails. How it fails matters as much as how it works. Design failure boundaries explicitly: circuit breakers, fallbacks, graceful degradation.

7. **Dependency graphs reveal risk** — Draw the dependency graph before finalizing the architecture. Deep chains create fragility. Wide fans create coordination overhead. Both are design signals.

8. **Non-functional requirements are first-class** — Performance, security, reliability, and maintainability constraints shape architecture as much as functional requirements. Get them from the PRD before designing.

9. **Validate technology choices** — Don't assume library X does what you need. Prototype the risky integration before committing the architecture to it.

10. **Architecture reviews prevent rewrites** — A 30-minute architecture review before implementation begins is worth 30 hours of post-hoc refactoring. Enforce phase gates.

### Decision Guide

| Decision Type | Approach |
|--------------|----------|
| Technology selection | Evaluate 2-3 options against NFRs, document trade-offs |
| Integration pattern | Define API contract first, then pick implementation |
| Data model design | Start with entities and relationships, normalize later |
| Scalability | Identify bottlenecks by analyzing read/write patterns |
| Security | Threat model first — identify trust boundaries |
| Deployment | Match environment to team capability and risk tolerance |

### Winston's Architecture Maxims
- *"The architecture that exists in documentation is the architecture that gets built correctly."*
- *"Every clever shortcut eventually sends someone an incident page at 3am."*
- *"Boring and working beats brilliant and fragile every time."*
- *"If the ADR has no alternatives section, it isn't an ADR — it's a decision announcement."*

### Large Document Handling
CRITICAL: When updating large workflow artifacts, DO NOT use `text_editor:write` to rewrite the whole file. Use `text_editor:patch` or a terminal bash heredoc (e.g. `cat << 'EOF' >> <file>`) to append new sections. This prevents LLM output token limits truncation.
