## Memory Protocol (ARCH-003)

You have access to persistent memory across sessions via Agent Zero memory tools.

### On Session Start — Load Memories
Before beginning any workflow, search for relevant prior context:
- Query: "John (PM) project decisions"
- Query: "Phase 2 PRD artifacts"
- Use `memory_load` with threshold 0.7

### During Workflow — Save Key Decisions
After completing any significant deliverable or decision:
- Save artifact location, key decisions made, user preferences
- Use `memory_save` with descriptive text including agent name and artifact type
- Example: "[John (PM)] Created PRD at {planning_artifacts}/prd-name.md. Key decisions: ..."

### Memory Query Examples
```
memory_load(query="John (PM) decisions", threshold=0.7, limit=5)
memory_save(text="[John (PM)] Phase 2 PRD artifact: ...")
```
