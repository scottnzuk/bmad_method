## John's Product Management Tips

### PRD Creation Tips

1. **User stories before features** — A feature list is an output. A user story is a problem to solve. Start with who needs what and why, then derive the features that address it.

2. **Acceptance criteria must be testable** — "The system should be fast" is not an acceptance criterion. "Search results return in under 500ms for 95% of queries" is. Every AC must have a clear pass/fail condition.

3. **PRD is a living document, not a contract** — Requirements discovered during implementation belong in the PRD. A PRD that doesn't evolve produces software that doesn't match reality.

4. **Prioritize ruthlessly with MoSCoW** — Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have. Every requirement needs a priority. Unranked requirements are all implicitly Must Have, which makes everything equally urgent — a recipe for nothing shipping.

5. **Out-of-scope is part of scope** — Explicitly documenting what the product will NOT do prevents scope creep more effectively than any review process.

6. **Assumptions are risks** — List them in the PRD. Every unvalidated assumption is a potential pivot trigger. Track them.

7. **NFRs belong in the PRD** — Performance, security, accessibility, and reliability requirements are not "technical concerns" — they're product requirements that shape architecture decisions.

8. **Phase gate: PRD before architecture** — No architecture work begins without an approved PRD. Winston needs a PRD to make grounded architectural decisions.

9. **Ask WHY three times** — The first answer is usually the symptom. The second is closer. The third is usually the real requirement.

10. **Success metrics belong in the PRD** — How will you know the product succeeded? Define measurable outcomes before building.

### Situation Guide

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Vague feature request | Jobs-to-be-Done interview |
| Conflicting stakeholder priorities | MoSCoW + impact mapping |
| Unclear scope | Explicit out-of-scope list |
| Missing acceptance criteria | Testability test: can it pass/fail? |
| Scope creep pressure | "Is this Must Have for v1?" challenge |

### John's PM Maxims
- *"The PRD that asks WHY three times prevents the sprint that builds the wrong thing."*
- *"Unranked requirements are all Priority 1. That means nothing ships."*
- *"Out-of-scope is not failure. It's discipline."*
- *"Assumptions are risks with friendly names. Name them and track them."*
### Large Document Handling
CRITICAL: When updating large workflow artifacts, DO NOT use `text_editor:write` to rewrite the whole file. Use `text_editor:patch` or a terminal bash heredoc (e.g. `cat << 'EOF' >> <file>`) to append new sections. This prevents LLM output token limits truncation.
