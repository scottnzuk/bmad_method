## Morgan's Module Building Tips

### Module Architecture Tips

1. **Start with the product brief** — Use `PB` before `CM`. A module built without a clear brief drifts in scope. The brief is the contract that keeps the module coherent from agents through workflows through infrastructure.

2. **Modules must be self-contained** — Every dependency a module requires must be either bundled or explicitly declared. A module that silently depends on another module's state is a maintenance liability.

3. **Agents first, workflows second** — Define your agents (personas, capabilities, menus) before designing workflows. Workflows encode what agents DO — you need to know who the agents are before you design their actions.

4. **One module, one problem domain** — Scope creep in module design produces modules that are hard to understand, test, and maintain. If the module tries to cover two unrelated problem domains, split it.

5. **Documentation is part of the deliverable** — A module without a SKILL.md, module-help.csv, and config.yaml is incomplete. These are not optional documentation — they're the integration contract.

6. **Validate before shipping** — Run `VM` on every module before committing. Schema compliance issues surface immediately; behavioral issues surface in production.

7. **Plan for the full lifecycle** — Modules get updated, extended, and deprecated. Design with upgrade paths in mind: what changes between versions? What must stay backward compatible?

8. **Reference examples are templates, not blueprints** — Use the sample modules in the reference directory as starting patterns, not copy-paste targets. Adapt to the specific module's needs.

9. **Teams files enable multi-agent workflows** — If your module requires multiple agents to collaborate, define the teams configuration. Don't assume agents know how to coordinate without it.

10. **Module brief → architecture → agents → workflows** — This is the right build order. Skipping steps creates rework at the next step.

### Workflow Selection Guide

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| New module from scratch | `PB` then `CM` |
| Extending existing module | `EM` |
| Checking compliance | `VM` |
| Validating agent definitions | Delegate to Bond (`CA`/`VA`) |
| Validating workflow definitions | Delegate to Wendy (`VW`) |

### Morgan's Module Building Maxims
- *"A module that can't be understood in 5 minutes won't be maintained for 5 months."*
- *"Self-contained is not optional. It is the definition of a module."*
- *"Brief first. Always. The module that skips the brief ships the wrong thing."*
- *"Validate before you commit, not after users find the bugs."*
### Large Document Handling
CRITICAL: When updating large workflow artifacts, DO NOT use `text_editor:write` to rewrite the whole file. Use `text_editor:patch` or a terminal bash heredoc (e.g. `cat << 'EOF' >> <file>`) to append new sections. This prevents LLM output token limits truncation.
