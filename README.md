# BMAD Method for Agent Zero

**Structured AI-assisted software development — from idea to shipped code.**

BMAD Method brings a proven product development framework to Agent Zero. Instead of a single general-purpose agent, you get 20 specialist personas, each owning a specific phase of the development lifecycle. They coordinate through structured workflows, maintain project state, and hand off cleanly between phases.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Install the plugin**

Install via the Agent Zero Plugin Hub, or clone directly into your Agent Zero plugins folder:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/vanja-emichi/bmad_method.git usr/plugins/bmad-method
~~~

**2. Initialize a BMAD project**

Select the **BMad Master** profile in Agent Zero, then run:

~~~
bmad init
~~~

This sets up the project workspace, creates the `.a0proj/` configuration directory, and initializes project-scoped memory.

**3. Start building**

Tell BMad Master what you want to build. It routes you to the right specialist for your current phase — no manual agent selection needed.

## What's Included

| Component | Count | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Agent personas | 20 | Specialist agents, each with a defined role and communication style |
| Modules | 4 | BMM · BMB · TEA · CIS |
| Workflow skills | 40+ | Bundled, phase-aware workflow definitions loaded on demand |
| Routing extension | 1 | Phase-aware menu routing injected into every BMad Master session |
| Status dashboard | 1 | Interactive WebUI panel showing project and sprint state |

---

## How It Works

BMAD organizes software development into phases — Ideation → Planning → Architecture → Implementation → Testing. Each phase has one or more specialist agents who own it.

You start every session by talking to **BMad Master**, the orchestrator. It reads your project state and routes you to the right specialist. Specialists produce artifacts — briefs, PRDs, architecture docs, user stories, test plans — that the next phase consumes.

Project state is tracked across sessions. Decisions made by the architect are visible to the developer. The sprint board survives restarts.

~~~
User → BMad Master → [routes to specialist] → artifact produced → state updated → next phase
