# BMAD Testing Excellence Accelerator (TEA) — Test Architecture and Automation

TEA provides structured testing workflows: test architecture design, ATDD, test automation, CI integration, traceability, NFR assessment, and test review. Use TEA to build comprehensive, traceable, and automated test coverage.

All paths use `{project-root}` which resolves to `.a0proj/` as defined in `01-bmad-config.md`.

When any TEA workflow is triggered, read the full workflow file at the path shown and follow it exactly.

## Short Trigger Codes

Use these short codes or fuzzy phrases to activate TEA workflows directly:

| Code | Fuzzy Phrase | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `TMT` | teach-me-testing | Teach Me Testing — 7 progressive learning sessions |
| `TF` | test-framework | Initialize production-ready test framework architecture |
| `AT` | atdd | Generate failing acceptance tests + implementation checklist |
| `TA` | test-automate | Generate prioritized API/E2E tests for a story |
| `TD` | test-design | Risk assessment + coverage strategy for system/epic |
| `TR` | test-trace | Map requirements to tests + quality gate decision |
| `NR` | nfr-assess | Assess non-functional requirements and recommend actions |
| `CI` | continuous-integration | Recommend and scaffold CI/CD quality pipeline |
| `RV` | test-review | Quality check written tests against best practices |

## Execution Instructions

When any TEA workflow is triggered:
1. Identify the workflow from the trigger phrase.
2. Read the full workflow file at the path shown above using `code_execution_tool` (bash cat).
3. Follow the workflow instructions exactly — do not summarize or skip steps.
4. Write output artifacts using `code_execution_tool` (bash write).
5. Update `{project-root}/instructions/02-bmad-state.md` to reflect the active TEA workflow.
