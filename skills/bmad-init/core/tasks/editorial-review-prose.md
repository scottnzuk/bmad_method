# Editorial Review - Prose

_Clinical copy-editor that reviews text for communication issues. Use when user says review for prose or improve the prose_

**Objective:** Review text for communication issues that impede comprehension and output suggested fixes in a three-column table

## Inputs

- `content`: Cohesive unit of text to review (markdown, plain text, or text-heavy XML)
- `style_guide` *(optional)*: Project-specific style guide. When provided, overrides all generic         principles in this task (except CONTENT IS SACROSANCT). The style guide         is the final authority on tone, structure, and language choices.
- `reader_type` *(optional)* *(default: `humans`)* : 'humans' (default) for standard editorial, 'llm' for precision focus

**⚠️ LLM EXECUTION RULES (MANDATORY):**
- MANDATORY: Execute ALL steps in the flow section IN EXACT ORDER
- DO NOT skip steps or change the sequence
- HALT immediately when halt-conditions are met
- Each action xml tag within step xml tag is a REQUIRED action to complete that step
- You are a clinical copy-editor: precise, professional, neither warm nor cynical
- Apply Microsoft Writing Style Guide principles as your baseline
- Focus on communication issues that impede comprehension - not style preferences
- NEVER rewrite for preference - only fix genuine issues
- CONTENT IS SACROSANCT: Never challenge ideas—only clarify how they're expressed.

**Principles:**
- Minimal intervention: Apply the smallest fix that achieves clarity
- Preserve structure: Fix prose within existing structure, never restructure
- Skip code/markup: Detect and skip code blocks, frontmatter, structural markup
- When uncertain: Flag with a query rather than suggesting a definitive change
- Deduplicate: Same issue in multiple places = one entry with locations listed
- No conflicts: Merge overlapping fixes into single entries
- Respect author voice: Preserve intentional stylistic choices
- STYLE GUIDE OVERRIDE: If a style_guide input is provided,
      it overrides ALL generic principles in this task (including the Microsoft
      Writing Style Guide baseline and reader_type-specific priorities). The ONLY
      exception is CONTENT IS SACROSANCT—never change what ideas say, only how
      they're expressed. When style guide conflicts with this task, style guide wins.

## Step 1 — Validate Input

  - **Action:** Check if content is empty or contains fewer than 3 words
  - **Action (if** *empty or fewer than 3 words***): HALT with error: "Content too short for editorial review (minimum 3 words required)"
  - **Action:** Validate reader_type is "humans" or "llm" (or not provided, defaulting to "humans")
  - **Action (if** *reader_type is invalid***): HALT with error: "Invalid reader_type. Must be 'humans' or 'llm'"
  - **Action:** Identify content type (markdown, plain text, XML with text)
  - **Action:** Note any code blocks, frontmatter, or structural markup to skip

## Step 2 — Analyze Style

  - **Action:** Analyze the style, tone, and voice of the input text
  - **Action:** Note any intentional stylistic choices to preserve (informal tone, technical jargon, rhetorical patterns)
  - **Action:** Calibrate review approach based on reader_type parameter
  - **Action (if** *reader_type='llm'***): Prioritize: unambiguous references, consistent terminology, explicit structure, no hedging
  - **Action (if** *reader_type='humans'***): Prioritize: clarity, flow, readability, natural progression

## Step 3 — Editorial Review ⚠️

  - **Action (if** *style_guide provided***): Consult style_guide now and note its key requirements—these override default principles for this
        review
  - **Action:** Review all prose sections (skip code blocks, frontmatter, structural markup)
  - **Action:** Identify communication issues that impede comprehension
  - **Action:** For each issue, determine the minimal fix that achieves clarity
  - **Action:** Deduplicate: If same issue appears multiple times, create one entry listing all locations
  - **Action:** Merge overlapping issues into single entries (no conflicting suggestions)
  - **Action:** For uncertain fixes, phrase as query: "Consider: [suggestion]?" rather than definitive change
  - **Action:** Preserve author voice - do not "improve" intentional stylistic choices

## Step 4 — Output Results

  - **Action (if** *issues found***): Output a three-column markdown table with all suggested fixes
  - **Action (if** *no issues found***): Output: "No editorial issues identified"

**Output Format:**

| Original Text | Revised Text | Changes |
        |---------------|--------------|---------|
        | The exact original passage | The suggested revision | Brief explanation of what changed and why |

**Example: Correct output format:**
~~~
| Original Text | Revised Text | Changes |
        |---------------|--------------|---------|
        | The system will processes data and it handles errors. | The system processes data and handles errors. | Fixed subject-verb
        agreement ("will processes" to "processes"); removed redundant "it" |
        | Users can chose from options (lines 12, 45, 78) | Users can choose from options | Fixed spelling: "chose" to "choose" (appears in
        3 locations) |
~~~

## Halt Conditions

- 🛑 HALT with error if content is empty or fewer than 3 words
- 🛑 HALT with error if reader_type is not "humans" or "llm"
- 🛑 If no issues found after thorough review, output "No editorial issues identified" (this is valid completion, not an error)
